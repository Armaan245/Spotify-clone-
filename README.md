# Spotify-clone-
Spotify Web Player Clone built with only HTML and CSS. It replicates Spotify’s core UI features including sidebar navigation, playlists, trending tracks, and a fixed bottom music player bar. This project offers a responsive, sleek front-end design that mimics Spotify’s look without JavaScript.
